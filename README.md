# Welcome to iKure Digital Health
Our inspirational dream is to achieve zero mortality from the lack of primary healthcare. To provide primary healthcare services to 50 million people in the next 2 years is our greatest challenge. Our focus is to increase our knowledge of the health of our patients.

iKure Digital Health enables iKure and ecosystem partners to achieve this collective mission through a range of digital tools, technologies, and services.

### What do we do?
