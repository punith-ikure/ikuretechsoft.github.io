## Projects
### Medical Device Integration
We are looking to achieve 100% medical device integration (MDI) for digital diagnostic devices we use in iKure also by our partners. In Februrary, we could see major progress with 3 device manufacturers. Out of which, we have done API-level integration with Scanbo, a small digital PoC device that can take blood pressure, temperature, SPO2, and ECG using sensors. The other two devices are HealthCube and TrueHb.

### Naga Telehealth

Naga Telehealth Dashboard showcases key indicators on teleconsultations being done across 164 Health and Wellness Centers - SHC and 18 HWC-PHC/UPHC. Built on a combination of ReactJS, D3.js, Nivo, and other frontend framework and libraries, team is adding several data visualizations and interactions in the Dashboard .

## Team
